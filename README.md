# UBC IMPACT CLUB APP

### What will the application do:

A few friends and I are starting a club called UBC IMPACT, 
helping slum kids in Kenya. Our club will consist of two 
departments: Education and Funding. For the Education part, 
we will have UBC volunteers from different majors help answer 
academic questions from Kenya high school students, and we will 
record teaching videos or find free resources online to address 
certain topics that students need clarification on. For the Funding 
part, we will organize fundraiser events to help them resolve 
financial issues. I am designing this application to help us save 
and update all the information from the Kenya and UBC sides.
This application will also help us identify the most urgent issues, 
trigger quick actions and match the most appropriate resources from our
side to solve the problems.

### Who will use this app:
- Kenya high school students. The students are coming from Korogocho, 
which is one of the largest slum regions in Kenya. They join our club with 
academic confusion and financial issues. All the problems they are 
encountering will be saved into this application and accessible by UBC volunteers.
- UBC volunteers. These are academically strong and kind-hearted UBC students 
coming from different majors. Our application will save their information 
for directors to match them with Kenyan students. They can also access all 
the data from Kenya independently and spot the issues they can help most.
- Other potential users. These could be Kenyan school teachers, UBC professors 
or other interested organizations from the society.

### Why is this project of interest to me:
- There is a huge gap in accessible education in developing countries, 
particularly for science education in marginalized communities. 
Our members are passionate about narrowing that gap on behalf of 
the UBC Science Community.
- After two months of planning, we just realized that this is a complicated 
thing to do, and a part of the reason is that there is so much information 
to process and match from both sides that human brains cannot manage. 
This app will help us a lot in terms of saving, updating and matching 
information and resources.
